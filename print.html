<p>This page is about the fundamental changes in the protocol on the way to the Coordicide. IOTA Chrysalis is like the metamorphosis of the butterfly, from the pupa to the finished butterfly.</p>
<p><img src="introduction/./assets/01_butterfly.png" alt="" /></p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#what-is-chrysalis" id="what-is-chrysalis">What is Chrysalis</a></h1>
<p>However, apart from Coordicide, the objective of the IOTA Foundation is to fully optimise the IOTA mainnet pre-Coordicide and offer an enterprise-ready solution to our ecosystem. We have therefore planned for an intermediate update called Chrysalis. This plan was first announced alongside our roadmap, but the scope has since been expanded. This post provides further information on what this upgrade to the IOTA Mainnet entails.</p>
<p>A chrysalis is “the form a caterpillar takes before it emerges from its cocoon as a fully-formed moth or butterfly”. In the context of IOTA, Chrysalis is the mainnet’s intermediate stage before coordicide is complete. To be clear, Chrysalis is separate to the coordicide efforts, and is aimed at improving usability of the current IOTA mainnet prior to coordicide.</p>
<p><img src="introduction/./assets/02_path_to.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Why is this process of adopting major protocol improvements relatively unique to IOTA among permissionless DLTs? The simple answer is the absence of miners. In most permissionless DLTs, the miners’ economic incentives conflict with those of the users of the network. Better throughput and lower latencies can disrupt the fee market miners rely on, and therefore agreeing to upgrade the network may affect their own profitability.</p>
<p>In IOTA, the validators and users are one and the same. There is no stubborn clash of incentives, meaning a much smoother path to network improvements. We will demonstrate this with the upcoming incremental upgrades to the network under Chrysalis.</p>
<p>So what are these incremental upgrades?</p>

The network will therefore allow for both quantum resistant one-time signatures and a more commonly used signature scheme allowing re-use of private keys. This will dramatically reduce transaction size, and consequently allow a significant increase in TPS. By introducing a new signature scheme we will also allow for reusable addresses, a very popular request from the community.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#atomic-transactions" id="atomic-transactions">Atomic transactions</a></h2>
<p><img src="introduction/./assets/what_is_chrysalis/05.png" alt="" />
<a href="https://iota.cafe/t/atomic-transfers-transactions-instead-of-bundles/318">Atomic transactions</a>. Move from the current Bundle construct and use simpler atomic transactions instead. This will reduce network overhead, reduce signature verification burden, improve spam protection and congestion control, and reduce length of Merkle proofs (for future sharding). In addition, it will reduce implementation efforts and increase maintainability of our core node software.</p>

<a href="https://iota.cafe/t/switching-to-utxo-model-for-balances-colored-coins-easier-conflict-resolution/229">Switch to UTXO model</a> from the current balance model. Every coin on an address is then uniquely identifiable and every spend names the exact coins that it wants to move. This allows for faster and more exact conflict handling and improves resilience and security of the protocol. In addition, switching to UTXO will make colored coins on IOTA possible. Combined with Mana (Coordicide) in the near future, this makes for a very attractive tokenization model and will further boost the adoption of the IOTA token.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#internal-binary-representation" id="internal-binary-representation">Internal Binary Representation</a></h2>

This allows us to work on binary data, for validation, IO and other processing without the need to have many binary-ternary conversions as in the current node software. The bundle hash can still be represented as 243 trits, such that the signing scheme stays the same and no transition of funds is necessary. This should lead to further improvements in performance.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#path-to-chrysalis" id="path-to-chrysalis">Path to Chrysalis</a></h1>
<p>One of the IOTA Foundation’s primary roles is to define and deliver on a development roadmap that moves IOTA towards production-readiness and adoption. In a complex and ever-changing ecosystem like DLT, having a clearly defined vision — and strategy on how to get there — is the key to success.</p>
<p>The IOTA mainnet has been operational since 2016 and so defining a new engineering strategy involves adapting our assumptions to industry feedback and demands. It also involves making difficult decisions to discontinue or redefine certain projects that are no longer feasible or relevant. At the core of this new strategy is an exclusive focus on technologies that will see adoption within a 2-year timeframe.</p>
<p>Research on Coordicide identified many new concepts that are incredibly valuable when implemented on the IOTA mainnet today. This led us to formalize our engineering strategy around Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5), a series of upgrades to the protocol that achieves enterprise-readiness before Coordicide.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is that much of the heavy lifting and migration for token holders and developers will take place before the launch of Coordicide, making for a simpler transition between Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5) and Coordicide (IOTA 2.0) upgrades.</p>
<p>The IOTA Foundation’s objective over the next two quarters is to successfully specify, implement, test, and upgrade the IOTA mainnet (and adjacent technologies) to this new version of the protocol.</p>
<p>The intended outcomes for Chrysalis are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simple transition to Coordicide</strong>: 
With Coordicide making significant progress and the Alphanet launch coming soon, we want to ensure that all developers and companies building on Chrysalis will not see any major breaking changes with the later transition to Coordicide</li>
<li><strong>Substantial performance improvements</strong>: 
With the changes introduced by Chrysalis, we will see a substantial improvement in the scalability and reliability of the IOTA Mainnet. The mainnet will be able to handle several hundred TPS</li>
<li><strong>Improved developer experience</strong>: 
The new protocol features, new libraries, new modules and new wallet will make IOTA one of the best platforms to build on, removing the friction which developers experience today</li>
<li><strong>Accelerated adoption</strong>: 
Chrysalis will make IOTA enterprise-ready, with stable and reliable technologies that will enable Startups, Corporations, and Governments to develop and launch products powered by IOTA</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-stages-to-chrysalis" id="the-stages-to-chrysalis">The Stages to Chrysalis</a></h2>
<p><img src="introduction/./assets/path_to_chrysalis/01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Chrysalis upgrade is a complex undertaking. We have to coordinate a number of distinct products to ensure a smooth transition for IOTA’s current users and partners. Apart from the core Node software, we also need to update our Wallet software, our Libraries, and the entire Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another important requirement is the ease of transition to the future Coordicide network. By carefully planning the breaking changes introduced along the way, and providing support in our developer tools, we will ensure that our growing ecosystem of developers, startups, and corporations can reliably develop and launch new innovative products on IOTA.</p>
<p>The plan for implementing Chrysalis is divided into two phases.</p>
<p>The first phase consisted of improved tip selection (URTS), Milestone selection, White flag, and Autopeering. These were implemented in the node software gradually. This phase required an upgrade of all nodes, including the coordinator node, and did not require a snapshot.</p>
<p>The outcome of the first phase of Chrysalis included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction confirmation times of around 10 seconds</li>
<li>Transactions only very rarely need reattachment</li>
<li>A substantial TPS increase on mainnet</li>
<li>Performance and reliability improvements for nodes</li>
<li>Reduced node setup times through autopeering</li>
</ul>
<p>The second phase consists of UTXO, Atomic Transactions, Reusable addresses (Ed25519) and the transition to a binary transaction layout. These represent significant changes to the core protocol and the way transactions are structured. Once everything has been tested, validated and audited, we will perform a global snapshot to allow the entire network, wallet users, and exchanges to upgrade. We currently estimate this to happen by the end of Q1 2021.</p>
<p>The outcome of the second phase of Chrysalis will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusable addresses and support for more standard cryptography (EdDSA), making hardware support for all major architectures possible</li>
<li>Simplified transaction layout and a reduction in transaction size, further increasing performance</li>
<li>Introduction of new features such as tokenized assets (colored coins)</li>
<li>Significant improvements to the usability and reliability of IOTA</li>
</ul>
<p>Node operators and integration partners will need to upgrade their nodes to stay in sync with the network and update any software with IOTA integration. We will reach out directly to exchanges, our partners, and the wider community to guide them through this process.</p>
<p>The introduction of reusable addresses is an important change for token holders. This will vastly improve IOTA’s usability and make integration into new exchanges, wallets, and payment systems much simpler. We are building a new wallet that will allow token holders to transition from the current WOTS address scheme to the new EdDSA scheme.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make this transition as seamless as possible for everyone in the IOTA ecosystem. This includes a variety of improvements and updates to our libraries and software, as well as training and educational sessions for our partners. We want to ensure that everyone is fully aware of how the future of the IOTA protocol will look and function, and what they need to do in order to upgrade.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#from-plan-to-action" id="from-plan-to-action">From Plan to Action</a></h3>
<p>Going into Chrysalis, we’ve had to make decisions on how to best implement these upcoming changes, ensuring a correct and timely implementation and seamless transition from our current state to Chrysalis and later to Coordicide. What follows is an overview of the various components we are working on to successfully implement this new future for IOTA.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#specification-and-standardization" id="specification-and-standardization">Specification and Standardization</a></h3>
<p>Specifications are a major part of our new development process. All our new software projects (Node software, Wallet, Identity, Access, Streams, etc.) will have full specifications. Specifications make it possible for external parties to follow a project’s intended functionality (e.g. for audits) or develop their own implementations in different languages. The specification process, which is also being followed by the Coordicide research team, is key to the standardization of IOTA and its related products.</p>
<p>For all the upcoming Chrysalis changes, we have introduced Protocol RFCs. Many Chrysalis components have been fully specified, and we intend to have them all completed by the end of May. We welcome any input from the IOTA and broader community. The list of RFCs includes:</p>

<p>The Trinity wallet is the most popular wallet in IOTA today. With Chrysalis, there is also a new wallet called <a href="https://blog.iota.org/firefly-iota-next-generation-wallet-26bdd4d01510/">Firefly</a>. The team has been working on a complete rethink of the wallet architecture, both for UX and UI but also from a security and functionality perspective. At its core will be a new wallet library written in Rust, to allow other developers to easily implement IOTA wallets within their applications. Another new Rust library, Stronghold, will enable ultra-secure secret handling and storage.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#infrastructure" id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the IOTA Foundation supports two public Networks: Mainnet and Devnet (Devnet is for PoCs and application tests). Both networks provide public endpoints for users and partners. You can read more about the networks and how you can participate in our <a href="https://docs.iota.org/getting-started/0.1/network/iota-networks?q=Devnet&amp;highlights=devnet">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>We will be migrating both Devnet and Mainnet to operate on Hornet, and later on both Hornet and Bee nodes. This will make both networks easier to maintain, and improve their throughput.</p>
<p><a href="https://comnet.thetangle.org/">Comnet</a>, a community network of Hornet nodes, operates at a stable rate of 40–100 TPS currently, and has already achieved 300 TPS in stress tests without any Chrysalis components yet.</p>
<p>With these infrastructure upgrades and the transition to Chrysalis, we will continue to be in close contact with all of our exchange and integration partners and provide them with close assistance and advice.</p>
<p><img src="introduction/./assets/path_to_chrysalis/02.png" alt="" />
See the live visualization of the Comnet: https://graph.comnet.manapotion.io/</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#chrysalis-testnet" id="chrysalis-testnet">Chrysalis Testnet</a></h3>
<p>Nodes deployed to the testnet can be queried using a load balancer at:</p>
<ul>
<li>api.lb-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend using the load balancer for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Single node endpoints that expose native MQTT in case you need this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>api.hornet-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
<li>api.hornet-1.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
<li>api.hornet-2.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
<li>api.hornet-3.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#conclusion" id="conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Chrysalis is the most promising series of upgrades made to IOTA yet. It is a major step for our enterprise-readiness, with increased transaction throughput, network stability, improved usability, and enables new features and use cases. The upcoming weeks and months are some of the most exciting in IOTA’s history. We are on a clear path towards IOTA’s adoption as an enabling technology for IoT and beyond.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#node-software" id="node-software">Node Software</a></h1>
<p>We have been running the network exclusively on the Go powered Hornet node since the summer of 2020. For Chrysalis, you will have the choice to continue using a new version of Hornet or you can use our new Test-based Bee node.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#hornet-and-bee" id="hornet-and-bee">Hornet and Bee</a></h3>
<p>Moving forward, the Hornet and Bee nodes have become IOTA’s core node software. </p>
<p>Hornet is an EDF-supported community node written in Go and has already proven itself to be a stable and performant implementation. It recently underwent a successful audit. </p>
<p>Bee is an IOTA Node implemented by the Foundation and written in Rust.</p>

<p>This is a quick guide meant to help you see the changes you will encounter while developing with the new network.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#a-note-about-seeds-and-addresses" id="a-note-about-seeds-and-addresses">A note about seeds and addresses</a></h2>
<p>In Chrysalis, all ternary conversions have been removed which results in a better and faster developer experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, the WOTS-Signature has been changed to the Ed25519 signature scheme. This means that you can now use an address multiple times to send and receive tokens. </p>
<p>And with all of these changes, the results encompass a completely different view of addresses and seeds:</p>
<p>IOTA 1.0 Address</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash=">UDYXTZBE9GZGPM9SSQV9LTZNDLJIZMPUVVXYXFYVBLIEUHLSEWFTKZZLXYRHHWVQV9MNNX9KZC9D9UZWZRGJMIGPDW

<pre><code class="language-bash=">atoi1qykf7rrdjzhgynfkw6z7360avhaaywf5a4vtyvvk6a06gcv5y7sksu7n5cs
</code></pre>
<p>With the new wallet library, developers do not need to use a seed anymore. The seed is now backed up with Stronghold, a software security box. It is not possible to remove the seed from this box since it uses encrypted snapshots that can be easily backed up and securely shared between devices. These snapshots are further secured by a password.</p>
<p>You can read more about Stronghold on the <a href="https://stronghold.docs.iota.org">Stronghold docs page</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#dust-protection" id="dust-protection">Dust Protection</a></h3>
<p>What is Dust? We define the spamming of a low value transaction as dust. A low value transaction in this case is a transaction with less than 1Mi value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the UTXO model, each node in the network needs to keep track of all the currently unspent outputs. When the number of outputs becomes too large, it can cause performance and memory issues. The RFC found below proposes a new protocol rule regarding the processing of outputs where they transfer a very small amount of IOTA’s so-called dust outputs. Dust outputs are only allowed when they are backed up by a certain deposit on the receiving address. This limits the amount of dust outputs, thus making it expensive to proliferate dust. Since a receiver must make a deposit, the protocol makes receiving dust an opt-in feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easily integrate IOTA with your exchange, custody solution, or product</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IOTA is built on an architecture that was designed to be the Backbone of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment of the future. This architecture has made it more challenging for service providers like exchanges to integrate IOTA compared to traditional blockchains. With the Chrysalis update, we ship many libraries to help developers implement IOTA into their applications.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-do-i-implement-it-to-my-exchange" id="how-do-i-implement-it-to-my-exchange">How do I implement it to my exchange?</a></h2>
<p>In wallet.rs, we use an account model. So you can create an account for each of your users. The other approach would be to use one account and generate many addresses, which you can link to your users in your database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account for every user -&gt; Multi Account approach</li>
<li>Create one account with many addresses -&gt; Single account approach</li>
</ul>
<p>The library supports derivation for multiple accounts from a single seed. An account is simply a deterministic identifier from which multiple addresses can be further derived. The following illustrates the relationships between seed, accounts and addresses. The library allows consumers to assign a meaningful alias to each account. It also leaves the choice to users if they want to segregate their funds across multiple accounts or multiple addresses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">                                  Address 0
                                /
root --- Account 0 --- Address 1
        \                        \
         \                         Address 2
          \                         
           Account 1 --- Address 0
                            \
                              Address 1    
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#multi-account-approach" id="multi-account-approach">Multi Account approach</a></h2>
<p>The multi account approach is to create an account for each individual user. The therewith created accounts can then be linked to the internal user ids as an account alias and are clearly separated.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#single-account-approach" id="single-account-approach">Single account approach</a></h2>
<p>The single account approach is to just use one account and create addresses for each individual user. The associated addresses are then linked to the internal user ids as an account alias and store who owns which address in the database.
Most exchanges are more familiar with the single account approach and find it easier to use, implement and backup.</p>

<p>The Wallet Library is a stateful package with a standardised interface for developers to build applications involving IOTA value transactions.

<p>The procedure for changing a stronghold password is &quot;simple&quot; in that you read a snapshot into a vault, and then write it out with a new encryption password. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/d1b8893d73aae35dfcf7c5c8006e2177988d25d0/src/stronghold.rs#L436-L451">See this code for the source.</a></p>
<p>Please note: for obvious reasons, old snapshot backups will not be &quot;rekeyed&quot;, so you have to track your old passwords. </p>

<p>IOTA 1.5 (also known as Chrysalis) is IOTA's intermediate stage before Coordicide is complete. You can read more about the strategy for releasing Chrysalis <a href="https://blog.iota.org/release-strategy-for-chrysalis-iota-1-5-4ea8741ea3a1/">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#infrastructure-1" id="infrastructure-1">Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>Nodes deployed to the testnet can be queried using a load balancer at:</p>
<ul>
<li>api.lb-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend using the load balancer for most scenarios.</p>
<p>Single node endpoints that expose native MQTT in case you need this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>api.hornet-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#iota-protocol-rfcs" id="iota-protocol-rfcs">IOTA Protocol RFCs</a></h1>
<p>To propose changes to the IOTA protocol, we ask for these to go through a more organized design process --- an RFC (request for comments) process. The goal is to organize work between the different developers affiliated with the IOTA Foundation, and the wider open source community. We want to vet the ideas early on, get and give feedback, and only then start the implementation once the biggest questions are taken care of.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#which-libraries-are-available-for-chrysalis" id="which-libraries-are-available-for-chrysalis">Which Libraries are available for Chrysalis?</a></h2>
<p>At this time, there are a handful of libraries available for Chrysalis which can be found below:</p>
<p>A low level library called iota.rs is a client library meant to connect with an IOTA node for core interactions with the Tangle. It is written in Rust and there are currently two bindings for Node.js and Python. </p>
<p>For Value Transactions there is the wallet.rs library which provides helpful functionalities to implement a IOTA Wallet into an application. It is also written in Rust and there are currently two bindings for Node.js and Python. </p>
<p>Additionally, there is also a native C (<a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.c">iota.c</a>) and a native javascript (<a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/chrysalis">iota.js</a>) client library. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-dust-protection-and-does-it-works" id="what-is-dust-protection-and-does-it-works">What is Dust Protection and does it works?</a></h2>
<p>Since IOTA is feeless and has the ability to send microtransactions, attackers could use this to spam the network, which we call Dust. To avoid this, you need to have a 1Mi amount of IOTA tokens on an address where you want to receive microtransactions.</p>
<p>You can read more about Dust Protection <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/pull/32">in the RFC here</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#whats-happening-with-coordicide" id="whats-happening-with-coordicide">What's happening with Coordicide?</a></h2>
<p>Chrysalis is a stage of the IOTA network that is still built on the Coordinator. With Coordicice, the IOTA Network will get rid of the Coordinator and become a completely decentralized network. There are three stages to reach Cooridice, which resolves in three Test neworks: Pollen, Nectar, and Honey. The Pollen Network runs in a research state on the goShimmer Node.</p>

<p>Confirmation times on the new network are great, average around 10 seconds to final. Once a transaction is set to confirmed it’s final instantly, you don’t have block confirmations like with blockchain.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#hornet-or-bee-which-node-should-i-use" id="hornet-or-bee-which-node-should-i-use">Hornet or bee? Which node should I use?</a></h2>
<p>You can pick Bee or Hornet, we currently recommend Hornet since it’s the more complete version of the node software, Bee is still missing some optional features you might want to have.</p>
