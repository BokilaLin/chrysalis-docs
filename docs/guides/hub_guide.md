# IOTA Hub Migration Guide

> This guide will explain, how you can switch from the Hub to the Wallet Library. 

Because of the unique architecture of IOTA 1.0, it was very difficult to handle IOTA transactions. With the new Chrysalis Update, a lot of things changed in the architecutre. 

The hub will not be upgraded to Chrysalis, but we have a new Wallet library, where you can implement IOTA wallets very easy.


- Setup Library
