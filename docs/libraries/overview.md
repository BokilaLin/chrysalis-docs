# Libraries

**The IOTA client libraries allow you to easily integrate IOTA into your own applications. Choose a library to match your use case.**

Official IOTA libraries serve as `one-source-code-of-truth` to IOTA users and providing binding to other programming languages. You can read more about core principles behind IOTA client libraries in the following blog [post](https://blog.iota.org/the-new-iota-client-libraries-harder-better-faster-stronger/).

- [client-lib](client.md)
- [wallet-lib](wallet.md)
- [iota.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js)
- [iota.c](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.c)
- [iota.go](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.go)

All libraries are in active development. The libraries target the Chrysalis testnet and do not work with current IOTA mainnet.

The client libraries with official support are maintained by the IOTA Foundation, their source code can be found on the [Official GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger).
