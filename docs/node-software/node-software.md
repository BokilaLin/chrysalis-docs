# Node Software

We have been running the network exclusively on the Go powered Hornet node since the summer of 2020. For Chrysalis, you will have the choice to continue using a new version of Hornet or you can use our new Test-based Bee node.

### Hornet and Bee

Moving forward, the Hornet and Bee nodes have become IOTAâ€™s core node software. 

Hornet is an EDF-supported community node written in Go and has already proven itself to be a stable and performant implementation. It recently underwent a successful audit. 

Bee is an IOTA Node implemented by the Foundation and written in Rust.
